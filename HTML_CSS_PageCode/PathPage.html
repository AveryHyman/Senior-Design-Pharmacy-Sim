                        <text>The following patient cases are designed with decision points with one best answer. Alternative answers may either be inappropriate or inferior to the best answer. Each question has points assigned and you will be able to track your point total as you progress through the cases. You should work independently to complete the cases, but you may utilize any resources you deem helpful. Your progress within a single case will not be saved unless you complete the case in its entirety. You may complete a single case or multiple cases in one session and return for additional cases. Time to complete each case may vary but should be able to be completed within 30 minutes. Please give your best effort to prepare you for the final assessment and ultimately for the patients you will care for in the future.
